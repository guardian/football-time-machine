                <p>The <span class="label label-success">Football Time Machine!</span> allows you to simulate time travel by replaying old PA data.</p>

                <h2>Usage</h2>

                <p>
                    You can use the <span class="label label-success">Football Time Machine!</span> by changing the URL you use to access the PA API.
                    Instead of (e.g.) <a href="http://pads6.pa-sport.com/">http://pads6.pa-sport.com/</a> you
                    should point to the <span class="label label-success">Football Time Machine!</span>, including
                    the date and time you wish to travel to. For example if you set <code>--time machine domain--/20140225/1550/</code>
                    you will recieve data as if it is 15:50 on the 25th of Feb 2014.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll need to choose a time and date for which there exists saved data.
                    The following date/time combinations are eligible for time travel
                </p>
                <p class="small">Note, historical data may not work for you if the API calls you are making weren't recorded at the time.</p>

                @for((date, time) <- dateTimes) {
                  <li>@date/@time</li>
                }
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
