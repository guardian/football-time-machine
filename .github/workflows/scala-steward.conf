# is allowed to create pull requests.

# pullRequests.grouping allows you to specify how Scala Steward should group
# your updates in order to reduce the number of pull-requests.
#
# Updates will be placed in the first group with which they match, starting
# from the first in the array. Those that do not match any group will follow
# the default procedure (one PR per update).

# pullRequests.customLabels allows to add custom labels to PRs.
# This is useful if you want to use the labels for automation (project board for example).
# Defaults to no labels (no labels are added).
